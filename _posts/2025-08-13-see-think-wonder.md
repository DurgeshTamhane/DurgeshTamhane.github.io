## Goal  
Help you turn an ordinary observation into a science experiment idea—just like real researchers do.

### Step 1 – See  
Look at something around you. It could be in your classroom, at home, or outside.  
Write down exactly what you notice—no guessing, just facts.  

**Example:**  
I see… an ice cube melting in a glass of water.

### Step 2 – Think  
Now write what you think might be happening, or why it’s happening. This is where you start making guesses (hypotheses).  

**Example:**  
I think… the ice is melting faster because the glass is in the sun.

### Step 3 – Wonder  
Ask questions that could be tested in an experiment.  

**Example:**  
I wonder… will the ice melt slower if I put the glass in the shade?

### Step 4 – Turn It into an Experiment  
Pick one of your “I wonder” questions and figure out how to test it.  

**Example:**  
**Experiment:** Put two glasses of water with ice—one in the sun, one in the shade—and measure how long each takes to melt.

💡 *Scientists often start with small observations, just like this. The most amazing discoveries can come from simply noticing something, thinking about it, and asking “I wonder…?”*
