## Introduction
Science often begins with curiosity — noticing something, wondering why it happens, and finding a way to test it.  
In this post, we’ll take the **See–Think–Wonder** framework and pair it with the **Phyphox** smartphone app to turn everyday observations into real, measurable experiments.

---

## Step 1 – See
Pick something around you that can be measured by your phone’s sensors.  
Some ideas:

- **Motion:** Elevator rides, swings, escalators (*Accelerometer*).  
- **Sound:** Classroom noise, hallway echoes (*Sound amplitude*).  
- **Magnetic fields:** Near chargers, laptops, or whiteboards (*Magnetometer*).  
- **Light:** Brightness near windows at different times of day (*Light sensor*).  

*Write down exactly what you see — no guesses yet.*

---

## Step 2 – Think
Now, make a prediction (your hypothesis) about what’s happening and why.  
Example:
> I think the light intensity will be lower near the window in the morning than in the afternoon.

---

## Step 3 – Wonder
Turn your observation into a measurable question.  
Example:
> I wonder how much the magnetic field changes when I move my phone from the classroom table to near a laptop charger.

## Step 4 – Collect Data with Phyphox
1. Install **[Phyphox](https://phyphox.org/)** on your phone.  
2. Open the app and choose the relevant experiment:
   - **Accelerometer** for motion/tilt.
   - **Sound amplitude** for noise levels.
   - **Magnetometer** for magnetic fields.
   - **Light** for brightness changes.
3. Record your data during the activity.
4. Export it as CSV for deeper analysis in Excel, Python, or Google Sheets.

## Step 5 – Analyse and Conclude
- Check for patterns or spikes in your recorded graphs.
- Compare your findings to your “Think” prediction.
- Ask yourself: Did the data confirm your idea or reveal something new?

## Example Classroom Activity – Sound
**Observation (See):** It’s noisy during lunch breaks.  
**Prediction (Think):** Noise will peak right when the bell rings.  
**Question (Wonder):** How quickly does the sound level drop after lunch break begins?  
**Method:**  
- In Phyphox, select *Sound amplitude*.  
- Start recording 30 seconds before the bell.  
- Stop recording after 2 minutes.  

**Example Result Graph:**  
![Lunch Break Noise Example](/files/posts/images/lunch_break_noise_example_optimized.png)  
*This graph shows a stable noise baseline before the bell, a sharp peak at the bell, and a gradual decay afterward.*

---

## Additional Example – Light Sensor
**Observation (See):** The brightness changes throughout the school day.  
**Prediction (Think):** Light intensity will peak at noon when the sun is highest.  
**Question (Wonder):** What is the pattern of light intensity from morning to evening?  

**Example Result Graph:**  
![Light Intensity Example](/files/posts/images/light_intensity_example_optimized.png)  
*The graph shows a clear midday peak in brightness, matching the prediction.*

---

## Additional Example – Magnetometer
**Observation (See):** Electronic devices seem to affect my phone’s compass.  
**Prediction (Think):** Magnetic field readings will be highest near power adapters.  
**Question (Wonder):** How much does the magnetic field strength vary at different spots in the classroom?  

**Example Result Graph:**  
![Magnetic Field Example](/files/posts/images/magnetic_field_example_optimized.png)  
*The bar chart shows strong magnetic fields near laptops and chargers.*

## Worksheet

| Step  | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **See** | What did you observe? |
| **Think** | What do you think is happening and why? |
| **Wonder** | What question can you ask that can be measured with Phyphox? |
| **Experiment Setup** | Which Phyphox tool will you use? How will you record data? |
| **Results** | What does your data show? |
| **Conclusion** | Did your data match your prediction? What did you learn? |

## Final Thoughts
By pairing **See–Think–Wonder** with **Phyphox**, you can move from curiosity to evidence-based conclusions. It’s a simple way to make science hands-on, data-driven, and fun — right from your smartphone. A stepping stone to research methodology.
