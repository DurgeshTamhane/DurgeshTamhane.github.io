# Effect of Temperature on Soda Fizz Speed

## Abstract
This study investigates how temperature affects the rate at which soda releases carbon dioxide gas (fizzing). By testing soda samples at three different temperatures—cold (5°C), room temperature (25°C), and warm (40°C)—we measured the time taken for the fizzing to visibly reduce. Results show that soda at higher temperatures loses gas faster, supporting the hypothesis that temperature accelerates gas release in liquids.

## Introduction
High school students are familiar with the fizz that occurs when soda bottles are opened. This fizzing is due to dissolved carbon dioxide escaping from the liquid. The rate of fizzing is believed to depend on temperature. This experiment was designed to test the effect of temperature on soda fizz speed and to demonstrate how everyday experiments can be documented in a scientific paper format.

**Research Question:** How does temperature affect the fizzing rate of soda?

**Hypothesis:** Warmer soda will fizz faster than colder soda because gas solubility decreases with increasing temperature.

## Methodology
- **Materials:** 3 soda bottles (same brand and size), thermometer, stopwatch, measuring cup, refrigerator, warm water bath.  
- **Procedure:**  
  1. Cool one soda to 5°C, keep one at room temperature (25°C), and warm one to 40°C.  
  2. Pour 200 ml of soda into a transparent cup.  
  3. Start the stopwatch immediately and record the time until visible fizzing slows down significantly.  
  4. Repeat the test three times for each temperature.  

## Results
| Temperature (°C) | Trial 1 (s) | Trial 2 (s) | Trial 3 (s) | Average Time (s) |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 5                | 210         | 200         | 215         | 208              |
| 25               | 160         | 155         | 165         | 160              |
| 40               | 95          | 100         | 92          | 96               |

**Observation:** The warmer the soda, the faster it lost its fizz.

## Discussion
The results support the hypothesis. At higher temperatures, soda fizzed more quickly because gas solubility decreases as 
temperature increases, causing carbon dioxide to escape faster.  
This simple experiment connects to real-world applications like beverage storage—colder storage keeps soda fizzy longer.  

Possible limitations include visual judgment of fizz reduction and slight variations in pouring technique.

## Conclusion
Temperature has a significant effect on soda fizz speed. Warm soda loses its gas faster, while cold soda retains
carbonation longer. This experiment shows how simple, everyday science can be structured and reported like professional research.  

**Future Work:** Students could extend this study by testing different soda brands, sugar-free vs. regular soda, or measuring exact
gas volumes released.
