# Imagine. Research. Innovate.

I work at the intersection of **corrosion monitoring**, **non-destructive evaluation (NDE)**, and **materialsâ€“electrochemistry**. My focus is on designing practical measurement systems that translate from fundamental concepts to field-ready tools.

---

## Current Focus
- Developing **electrochemical assessment techniques** for coatings, admixtures, and inhibitors.  
- Creating **sensor systems** based on Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI), Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC), and magnetic methods.  
- Applying **machine learning** for corrosion prediction using electrochemical and adhesion data.  
- Building experimental rigs and instruments for **field and laboratory validation**.  

---

## Research Interests
- Non-destructive evaluation of corrosion using EMI, PEC, and magnetic probes.  
- Cathodic protection and sacrificial anode health monitoring.  
- Electrochemical techniques: EIS, LPR, Tafel, CPP.  
- MEMS and piezoelectric microtransducers for corrosion sensing.  
- Machine learning for feature engineering and predictive models in corrosion studies.  

---

## Highlights
- **Patents:** Innovations in EMI-based anode monitoring and PEC-based rebar corrosion detection.  
- **Publications:** Contributions in IEEE Sensors Journal, Smart Materials and Structures, Construction & Building Materials, IEEE Access.  
- **Recognition:** Awards in student innovation contests and excellence in teaching assistance.  
- **Projects:** AI-driven corrosion prediction, IoT-enabled cathodic protection systems, and outreach for hands-on science learning.

## Approach
The guiding principle is to design **simple, reliable, and scalable measurement methods**. Starting from physical models, systems are built and validated with analytical tools, finite element simulations, and real-world testing. This ensures results that are both accurate and practically deployable.
