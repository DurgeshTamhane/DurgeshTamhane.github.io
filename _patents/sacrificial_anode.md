## Overview
This patent discloses an EMI-based system for monitoring sacrificial anodes used in cathodic protection of steel structures. By attaching a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer (PZT patch) to the anode, changes in electromechanical impedance caused by corrosion can be detected in real time. The system requires no additional complex hardware, provides a cost-effective way 
to track anode degradation, and is suitable for applications in pipelines, tanks, and reinforced concrete structures
