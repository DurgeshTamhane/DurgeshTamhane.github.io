## Overview
This patent describes an apparatus for non-destructive corrosion detection in conducting materials using pulsed eddy currents. A signal controller drives an excitation coil to induce currents, while a magnetic field sensor captures the response signal. A corrosion detection controller then analyzes changes—such as the area under the response curve—to distinguish corroded from non-corroded portions, enabling accurate assessment even at higher lift-off distances
