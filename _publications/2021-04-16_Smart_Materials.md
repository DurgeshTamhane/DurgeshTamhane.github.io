Monitoring the corrosion of sacrificial anodes in reinforced concrete structures typically requires either destructive inspection or
complex inverse modeling. 
This work introduces a vibration-based inverse graphical technique that estimates the thicknesses of both uncorroded zinc
and corroded zinc-oxide layers directly from two resonance frequencies—the radial expansion mode and the transverse “trampoline”
mode—captured through electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) sensing.

Unlike optimization-based approaches, the proposed method is calibration-free and computationally light,
relying on graphical intersections of analytical frequency relations. Its accuracy is validated using finite element simulations
and then demonstrated experimentally through accelerated corrosion tests on zinc anodes in saline environments.
The results show that the method can reliably track evolving thicknesses of corroded and uncorroded regions,
even under nonlinear delamination dynamics.

By combining simplicity, real-time applicability, and robustness, this technique opens a path for non-destructive,
quantitative assessment of sacrificial anodes in smart cathodic protection systems.
