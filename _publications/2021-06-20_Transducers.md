This paper adapts a frequency-domain contour-plot (graphical) inverse technique to estimate the thicknesses of the uncorroded zinc and corroded zinc-oxide layers on PZT-instrumented sacrificial anode discs. By deriving analytical expressions for radial and transverse resonance modes and plotting zero-level contours in the (h₁, h₂) plane, the intersection yields the layer thicknesses directly — no iterative optimization or calibration required. The method is validated with extensive finite-element simulations and impressed-current accelerated-corrosion experiments; results show strong agreement despite realistic non-uniform corrosion and delamination dynamics. The Transducers paper is the conference version of this contour-plot approach.
