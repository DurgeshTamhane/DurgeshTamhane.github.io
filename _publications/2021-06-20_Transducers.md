Corrosion monitoring systems for sacrificial anodes are often limited by wired connections and bulky instrumentation, 
restricting their practical deployment in field structures. 
This paper introduces a wireless smart sensor node that integrates a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer
with a low-power wireless communication module to perform electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) based sensing of anode health.

Through impressed-current accelerated corrosion experiments on zinc anodes in saline electrolytes,
the system demonstrates that resonance frequency shifts in the PZT-anode assembly can be reliably measured and transmitted wirelessly.
The compact design enables remote, real-time tracking of anode degradation without continuous wired monitoring.

The work establishes a foundation for IoT-enabled cathodic protection systems,
where embedded sacrificial anodes can self-report their health status, reducing maintenance costs and enhancing durability management
of reinforced concrete and marine structures.
