excerpt: "This paper reports how PDMS foam attenuates transmitted light under compression and demonstrates its use in a low-cost, repeatable weight sensor. The optical response follows an exponential fit akin to Lambert’s law, enabling precise sensing in the 500–2800 g range with no hysteresis."

This work explores the optical properties of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam, showing how compression alters its light transmission. 
Spectroscopic studies reveal that transmitted intensity decreases exponentially with foam thickness, consistent with Lambert’s law. 
Leveraging this effect, a simple weight sensor was fabricated using compressed PDMS foam placed between transparent plates and
illuminated with a light source. The sensor shows a linear response from 500 g to 2800 g with a sensitivity of 0.42 mV/kg, 
high repeatability, and no hysteresis. 
The study highlights PDMS foams as promising candidates for low-cost, lightweight optical sensing applications.

## Key Findings

- Optical response: PDMS foam attenuates transmitted light exponentially with thickness, consistent with Lambert’s law.

- Sensor design: A low-cost weight sensor was built using PDMS foam and a simple optical setup.

- Performance: The sensor showed linear response in the 500–2800 g range, with no hysteresis and excellent repeatability.

- Potential: Demonstrates feasibility of PDMS foams as lightweight, inexpensive materials for optical sensing applications.
