Corrosion of reinforcing steel bars in concrete structures is a leading cause of durability loss in civil infrastructure.
This work introduces a low-cost pulsed eddy current (PEC) sensing system that employs a novel probe combining an excitation coil with a
high-resolution anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensor. The probe achieves high sensitivity to corrosion at lift-off distances up
to 55 mm while using only 0.2 A excitation current, making it suitable for reinforced concrete with significant cover depth.

A key contribution is the feature engineering of time-domain PEC signals. Instead of relying on raw signals,
the study extracts area-under-the-curve (AUC) features from selected time segments and applies principal component analysis (PCA)
to enhance discrimination between corroded and uncorroded regions. PCA not only improves detection at larger
lift-offs but also enables quantitative estimation of rebar diameter loss, validated through accelerated corrosion tests and 
chamfered rebar samples.

The approach demonstrates that PCA-based feature engineering substantially boosts the robustness and resolution of PEC sensing,
paving the way for portable, field-deployable NDT systems for real-time rebar corrosion monitoring.

## Key Findings
- **PEC probe design:** Compact coil + AMR sensor probe detects rebar corrosion at lift-offs up to 55 mm with only 0.2 A excitation.  
- **Feature engineering:** Area-under-the-curve (AUC) features from time-domain PEC signals improve sensitivity over raw signals.  
- **PCA application:** Principal component analysis enhances discr
