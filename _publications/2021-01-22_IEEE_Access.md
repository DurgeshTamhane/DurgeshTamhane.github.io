Sacrificial anodes are widely used in cathodic protection systems to shield steel structures from corrosion, 
yet their own degradation is rarely monitored in real time. This paper presents a smart cathodic protection system that leverages
electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) sensing with PZT transducers to track corrosion progression of zinc anodes.
By monitoring shifts in the radial expansion resonance mode, the system provides a quantitative indicator of anode deterioration. 
Accelerated corrosion experiments in saline electrolyte confirm that resonance frequency evolution strongly correlates with zinc loss
and zinc oxide delamination. An analytical model, supported by finite element validation, captures the nonlinear effects of
partial delamination. To the authors’ knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a cathodic protection system with
built-in sensing of sacrificial anode degradation, 
paving the way for IoT-enabled, real-time structural health monitoring of critical infrastructure.


## Key Findings
- **Resonance tracking:** Shifts in radial expansion mode frequencies of PZT–anode assemblies directly quantify zinc anode degradation.  
- **High sensitivity:** EMI detects early-stage corrosion more effectively than conventional electrochemical monitoring.  
- **Analytical & FEM validation:** Nonlinear effects of zinc-oxide delamination are captured well by models and supported by experiments.  
- **Smart cathodic protection:** First demonstration of a cathodic protection system with built-in real-time sensing of sacrificial anode health.
