excerpt: "A head-to-head comparison of pulsed eddy current (PEC) and electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) techniques for quantifying corrosion of zinc sacrificial anodes. Experiments and FEM show EMI is highly sensitive to incipient corrosion while PEC provides linear tracking over anode lifetime — suggesting a combined sensing strategy."

This paper directly compares two complementary non-destructive sensing approaches for tracking corrosion of zinc sacrificial anodes
used in cathodic protection systems. Using the same accelerated impressed-current corrosion rig, the authors instrument anodes with a 
PZT transducer for electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) measurements and deploy a pulsed eddy current (PEC) probe nearby. 
EMI sensitivity is quantified via the RMSD of conductance spectra around resonant peaks, while PEC analysis uses area-under-the-curve (AUC)
features of time-domain responses. Finite element simulations corroborate the experiments.

## Key Findings
- EMI shows very high sensitivity to the onset (incipient) corrosion but its sensitivity declines nonlinearly over time due to delamination of corrosion by-products.  
- PEC shows excellent linearity across the full accelerated-corrosion duration and is therefore better suited for tracking cumulative material loss.  
- An effective monitoring strategy would exploit EMI for early detection and PEC for lifetime tracking.  
- FEM models and experimental measurements agree with the observed comparative performance.
