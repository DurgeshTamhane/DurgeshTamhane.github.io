This work proposes a simple non-destructive technique to detect corrosion of steel reinforcing bars in reinforced cement concrete (RCC) 
by **measuring magnetic force** changes with a strain-gauge–based cantilever setup. A neodymium magnet exerts force on rebars,
and the resulting deflection of a strain-gauge cantilever is measured using a Wheatstone bridge circuit. 
The voltage output correlates directly with the degree of corrosion.

PVC-coated samples were also tested, and results confirm that insulation does not significantly affect detection accuracy —
demonstrating applicability to **in-situ corrosion monitoring of insulated pipelines**.

## Key Findings
- Magnetic-force–based measurement shows clear sensitivity to the degree of corrosion in steel rebars.  
- Bridge voltage decreases systematically with increased corrosion due to loss of ferromagnetic material.  
- Results are consistent for both bare and PVC-insulated rebars, confirming insulation does not hinder detection.  
- The approach provides a simple, low-cost, and calibration-free method suitable for in-situ monitoring of reinforced concrete structures.
