## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the corrosion performance of coatings on steel plates using machine learning models trained on weight change, capacitance (electrochemical measurements), and adhesion strength data.

## Goals
- Validate whether wet-dry saltwater cycling causes measurable degradation.
- Scale the experiment for broader corrosion performance prediction.

## Methodology
- Single coated steel plate experiment for preliminary testing.
- Measure weight change, capacitance, and adhesion over multiple cycles.
- Analyze data using statistical and ML techniques to predict performance.

## Outcome
- Detectable corrosion (â‰¥0.2g weight loss) validated.
- Framework established for full-scale machine learning experiments.
