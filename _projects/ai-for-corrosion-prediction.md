This project focuses on building **machine learning models** to predict the corrosion performance of coated steel plates using data such as weight change, capacitance (electrochemical measurements), and adhesion strength. It establishes a framework to scale from simple lab experiments to predictive corrosion modeling.

## Goals
- Validate whether wet-dry saltwater cycling causes measurable degradation.
- Scale the experiment for broader corrosion performance prediction.

## Methodology
- Single coated steel plate experiment for preliminary testing.
- Measure weight change, capacitance, and adhesion over multiple cycles.
- Analyze data using statistical and ML techniques to predict performance.

## Outcome
- Detectable corrosion (â‰¥0.2g weight loss) validated.
- Framework established for full-scale machine learning experiments.
